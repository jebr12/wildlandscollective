                                   <strong>Iceland’s West Fjords region is one of the country’s most remote areas and offers endless outdoor pursuits in its mountains, sheltered fjords and bays. Aurora´s favourite area in the West Fjords is the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve, with its rich history and unspoilt landscapes. The area is virtually inaccessible. There are no roads in the nature reserve—the only way to venture there is by boat. Due to its remote location it is very possible to stay there for days without meeting a single soul. Doing so, you will discover the essence of remote Iceland. The fjords are deep and dramatic, marine and aviary life abound, and an abundance of silence and unexplored landscapes abound for the curious and adventurous explorer.</strong>

                                                    <p>This trip is a true Arctic Expedition to the beautiful Hornstrandir Nature Reserve in the West Fjords of Iceland—only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. 
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                   We focus on backcountry skiing between the remote fjords, anchoring in a different harbour each night. Many of the mountains and ridges have never been skied before and our guides are always looking for nice first descents. There is a diversity of   slope grades,  and we will plan our routes to fit people of all backcountry touring abilities and interests. Most people use AT (randonnée) or Telemark skis, but snowboards, cross-country skis or snowshoes can be used as well. While we usually spend about 6-8 hours in the mountains each day, for those who prefer shorter days, individuals can simply ski down to the anchored boat when they so choose. 
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    While the season is primetime for skiing, we will still carry a few kayaks on the yacht for those eager or interested in taking a break from skiing and doing some kayaking as well (please enquire about the kayaks).
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    The expedition yacht "Aurora Arktika" is our movable ‘backcountry hut’ and awaits us at the end of every day with gourmet meals, warm and comfortable bunks, and friendly conversation.<br/><br/>

                                                    <strong>SAILING YACHT - AURORA ARKTIKA</strong><br>
                                                    The sailboat is a 60 foot sloop built by Colvic Craft in the UK in 1996. She was designed by David Pedrick for the Clipper Round the World Race and has been raced around the world four times. Aurora’s previous owner, Clipper Ventures Plc (based in Gosport, UK), was founded by the legendary sailor, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who in 1969 became,the first person to singlehandedly sail around the world non-stop. Sir Robin was in Ísafjörður and on the yacht (then named Antiope Clipper) in the summer of 2005, together with Sir Chris Bonington and other friends, en route to Greenland. Over some chicken curry and beer on-board, we decided to fulfill an old dream and buy the yacht!<br></br>
                                                    Accommodation is seamanlike — simple and utilitarian — but the vessel is very sturdy and spacious. There are ten single berths, one of which can be turned into a double - accomodating up to a total of 11 guests. Sleeping bags are required for this expedition.<br></br>
                                                    The yacht has good heaters, hot and cold water, good galley and spacious communal areas, two heads (toilets) and one shower.  There is 220V electricity to charge batteries and other electronic devices. The vessel was initially fitted out for 15 crew, but can now accommodate 12 people—2 crew and 10 guests. The boat is equipped according to strict Icelandic regulations in regards to emergency equipment.</p>

                                                    <p>This trip is far from a "packaged tour." Think of it more as a "floating backcountry lodge" in the midst of one of the world's great arctic wildernesses that will allow you to truly grasp the sense of place that the remote Hornstrandir conveys. Even though we may not be far from “home,“ this is still true exploration and the final itinerary will only be decided upon when we leave Ísafjörður harbour. Below is the most likely itinerary, but we will take into account weather and snow-conditions and always look for the best possible option. <br/><br/>
                                                        <strong>Day 1</strong><br>
                                                    Departure from Ísafjörður will take place at 19:00, with 2-4 hours of sailing to Hesteyri in the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve. We will relax at anchor and maybe do some exploration on the Zodiac and take a look at the old whaling station that once was the driving force in this now abandoned settlement. Since it will still bright in the evening during the latter part of the season, for later trips we will have an option to do a short ski run.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 2</strong><br>
                                                    We'll begin the day with a safety briefing that will include avalanche search techniques and an explanation of what to do in case of an emergency. We will then ski from Hesteyrarfjörður to Veiðileysufjörður ('fjord with no fish'!). The climb up Hesteyrarfjörður is very easy and the ski slopes on the other side offers many possibilities. We may end the day by skiing the steepest slope of the trip, 45°-50° in steepness (of course this is optional—you can head down to the yacht if you prefer!). Dinner will be at anchor in Veiðileysufjörður.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 3</strong><br>
                                                    We will ski to Lónafjörður (lagoon fjord). We begin the day by climbing up to one of the cols to take a look at the bays on the north side. We then ski down to the first valley in Lónafjörður and climb at least two more mountains before meeting Aurora again in the evening.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 4</strong><br>
                                                    Here, we normally spend an extra day at the beautiful Rangali anchorage. Here are endless opportunities for skiing. From steep couloirs to rolling hills. One route will take us to the Snókur Mountain with a good view of the coastal mountains on the east side of Hornstrandir. Often there is an opportunity to pick mussels for après ski!</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 5</strong><br>
                                                    Today we skin up from the Sópandi inlet and over to Hrafnfjörður (Raven Fjord). The mountain cirque at the head of the fjord is very beautiful and the anchorage is a perfect spot to spend the night.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 6</strong><br>
                                                    We will have a morning ski session before sailing back to Ísafjörður, with arrival around 16:00 in the afternoon. You can catch the last flight from Ísafjörður that night, though we suggest staying at least one night in Ísafjörður to relax and get to know this old and beautiful town.</p>

                                                    Although I ski on a daily basis, I've never been guided. The thought of an adamant guide choosing objectives and approaches, insisting on breaking trail, and mandating the location of every kick turn terrifies me. A guide telling you how fast you can't ski and constantly mentioning their breadth of experience and avalanche this and that isn't what I was looking for when I signed on for a trip with Borea. Instead, I wanted real skiers to show me the terrain available in their back yard. I wanted them to be Icelandic, to speak English, to understand what I wanted to ski, and to create a package perfect for what our group of skiers sought. I found my desires, and avoided my hesitancies, in Borea. Understanding the skill level and wishes of our group would not be an easy undertaking for a service who is used to spoon-feeding clients. I'm not sure if this is what Aurora is used to, but our requests surely did not seem to present an issue. And this includes some strange dietary requests, along with first descent requests. The pre-trip communication was adequate without being overwhelming, the logistics were handled but malleable, and the objectives were open for discussion. And while this isn't what every group will need, and surely not the only type of service that Aurora offers, it's what we wanted. Never having been guided before, I wasn't even fully clear on what I wanted. I was familiar with my fears and hesitation in hiring a guide, but unfamiliar with what the experience would actually be like. After a few days in far-fetched Icelandic fjords, I learn that guides aren't necessarily the outdoor version of "desk jockeys" that wear pins with all sorts of acronyms on them. Instead, they're friends. I will absolutely return to Aurora next time I'm in Iceland. And I'm coming back to Iceland next year because Aurora is here.</br></br>

                                                    We came as a group of professional skiers from the USA to have a unique ski experience in Iceland. From day 1 the Aurora team impressed us with their organization, communication and professionalism. We were so delighted when we met the crew in isafjordur to learn that equal to their professionalism is their friendly and relaxed nature. Over the next five days we had an incredible adventure transported by van, speedboat, sailboat, dingy and ski touring. We made first descents, saw beautiful sights, wildlife and captured the whole experience with the in house photographer, hauker. The team was on point as ski guides, cooks, organizers, story tellers and eventually dear friends. Whatever your desires are for your Iceland vacation, I have no doubt Borea Adventure will take immaculate care of you.<br></br>

                                                    I went on a weeklong ski tour with Borea adventures in Hornstrandir in May 2012 with a group of friends. Siggi (the captain and chef or Aurora) and Örvar (ski guide) led us through unforgettable week of skiing, sailing, eating and having fun in an environment that simply cannot be matched. Different fjord each day with excellent ski slopes that runs down to the ocean. Excellent food on board. I highly recommend this tour.</p>

                                                    <strong>RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL</strong><br>
                                                    We believe strongly in low impact -or rather 'positive impact' tourism. Broadly speaking, this means that we try to minimise the negative aspects of tourism on the local cultures and environments that we visit and highlight the positive aspects. The beauty of this trip is that we use nature's renewable energy to power the majority of our needs.<br></br> 


                                                    <strong>HEALTH AND PHYSICAL PREPARATION</strong><br>All travellers need to be in good physical health in order to participate fully in the group travel experience. If, in the opinion of our group leader, any traveller is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Aurora-Arktika reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund. We therefore ask that you read the itinerary in these trip notes thoroughly and then realistically self-assess your physical ability to complete the trip as described. Please consult with your doctor if you have any doubts.<br></br>
                                                    While no specific physical preparation is required for this voyage, to get the most out of the land and sea activities, a better than average fitness level is recommended. We recommend that you undertake regular aerobic exercise in the weeks before you travel, particularly if you are not in the habit of regular exercise. And of course the best way to get into shape for skiing...is skiing!<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>YOUR FELLOW TRAVELLERS</strong><br>
                                                    As you travel in a group trip you will be exposed to both the pleasures and as well as the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow travellers will probably come from all corners of the world and are likely to cover a range of age groups. We ask that you be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group—patience with your fellow travellers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember that you have certain responsibilities to the group. We have found time and time again that the very best trips we operate are those where the dynamics within the group work well—this only takes a little effort on your part. Please note that due to privacy reasons we are unable to provide you with contact details and any personal information about your fellow travellers booked on your trip, prior to departure, unless they choose to share such info.<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>FOOD</strong><br>
                                                    We take great pride in the food we serve on board Aurora and use local produce and ingredients as much as we can. Arctic char, cod, lamb and berries and rhubarb pies for desserts are common. We can cater for vegetarians and guests with dietary restrictions. Please let us know in advance. It´s a good idea to take some of your own dietary substitutes if you have a specialist diet.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>VISAS</strong><br>
                                                    No visa is required for trips to Iceland of up to 3 months for most nationalities. Please check with your consulate in advance of your proposed travel date.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>ACCOMMODATION AND TRANSFER</strong><br>
                                                    Aurora-Arktika can help with arranging accommodation in Reykjavík, please enquire. For accommodation in Ísafjörður, we recommend Gamla Guesthouse (www.gistihus.is) in the centre of town. Good atmosphere in an old refurbished house. Please mention that you´re coming on a trip with us in order to receive a 15% discount.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>COMMUNICATION</strong><br>
                                                    There is good mobile phone coverage and internet service in Ísafjörður. Mobile coverage is not good where we travel, though most days there is reception on the mountain tops! On board, Aurora will have a satellite phone that can be used for urgent calls or emails.<br></br> 

                                                    <strong>SEA-SICKNESS</strong><br>
                                                    We only sail short distances during this trip, and sea sickness has not proven to be problematic. Still, it´s a good idea to bring medication if you know you are prone to seasickness or you think it will be helpful.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>BOOKING CONDITIONS AND INSURANCES</strong><br>
                                                    The Aurora-Arktika´s trips/voyages are of an adventurous nature given the relatively remote places throughout Iceland, Greenland and beyond that we travel. Aurora-Arktika makes its best effort to stick to the planned itinerary, but participants should appreciate and acknowledge that the trip/voyage requires considerable flexibility. Further, given the unpredictability of travel in such locations, the captain or Aurora-Arktika cannot be held responsible for incidents, accidents or physical injuries.The company and captain of the vessel reserve the right to adjust the itinerary without notice for reasons beyond their control, such as weather, ice-conditions or other unpredictable or unforeseeable circumstances. Upon departure, the captain will have the final say on all decisions affecting safety, etc., and this must be accepted by all participants. <br></br>

                                                    Sailing and other outdoor activities in the trips can be dangerous and require an average level of fitness and good health. It is the responsibility of all participants to ensure that they obtain proper and detailed medical advice. In case of a medical problem arising during the voyage, either on-board or onshore, which results in medical expenses—including but not limited to costs for evacuation with use of aircraft or boat and repatriation—the responsibility for payment of these costs belongs solely to the respective participant. We require that the participants ensure that such eventualities are covered by travel insurance. If for any reason an incident is not covered by travel insurance, the responsibility still remains with the participant. Be aware that a normal travel policy may not cover you for some geographical areas that we travel and there may be exclusions for what they describe as "hazardous sports," which may include sailing, climbing, skiing and diving (especially in remote areas). Before arrival, participants must provide the name, address and telephone numbers for emergency contacts who can be reached should it prove necessary.<br></br>

                                                    Any personal belongings taken on-board the yacht by participants are taken entirely at the participants risk.  As such, Aurora-Arktika shall not be liable for any loss or damage occurring to them.<br></br>


                                                    <strong>ISSUES ON YOUR TRIP</strong><br>
                                                    While we always endeavour to provide the best possible holiday experience, due to the nature of travel and the areas we visit sometimes things can and do go wrong. Should any issue occur while you are on your trip it is imperative that you discuss this with your group leader or the captain straight away so that they can do their best to rectify the problem and mitigate any potential negative impacts during the rest of your trip.<br></br>
