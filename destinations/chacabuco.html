                                   <strong>Situated in the soon-to-be-opened Patagonia National Park, which has the potential to rival Torres del Paine for its remote wilderness beauty, this lodge is big news in Patagonia. Not only is the former estancia one of the largest grasslands-recovery projects in the world—thanks to Conservacion Patagonica, the land trust founded by American philanthropist Kris Tompkins—but the hiking, wildlife, and infrastructure are first-class. The six-room, pitched-roof stone building was inspired by Ahwahnee Lodge in Yosemite and sits in the foothills of the southern Andes. With dark wood walls, cream sofas, and multiple fireplaces, it's ranch elegance at its finest. Plus it's sustainable, with fresh greenhouse vegetables and solar energy. Outside, the park is full of guanacos, endangered huemul deer, flamingos, and pumas: a far cry from the overgrazed estancia Chacabuco was when Tompkins took over in 2006. Lodge guests can get a jump on exploring the more than 600,000 wild, surrounding acres</strong>

                                                    <p>Named one of Chile’s best 12 hotels by Outside Magazine, the Lodge at Valle Chacabuco combines classic design, luxurious accommodations and unparalleled access to the future Patagonia National Park. Completed in 2008, the six-bedroom stone-and-wood Lodge takes inspiration from historic hotels such as Yosemite’s Ahwahnee and Yellowstone’s Old Faithful Lodge, but offers guests a more intimate and personal experience. 
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    Designed and decorated in the style of historic Patagonian estancias, the Lodge epitomizes classic, rustic elegance. With handcrafted and largely antique furniture, original photography, and careful detail work, each room has a unique theme drawn from its surroundings. Classic and refined, this beautiful stone lodge was modeled on English architecture in southern Argentina. Patterned tiles, handsome wood and large photographic nature prints foster a warm ambience. There are just six guest rooms, mostly doubles with some bunks for families. 
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    The Lodge faces towards Mount Tamanguito, the peak behind the main park headquarters. A central living and dining room provides a space for guest to gather at mealtimes and at night. The full bar, wood fireplace and numerous couches allow guests to relax at the end of days, while an entertainment system and large screen offer a chance to view documentaries on the park and Patagonia, as well as other films. From time to time, Conservacion Patagonica staff and visiting experts will give presentations on their work.
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    Breakfast and dinner is served in an intimate, communal setting, and picnic lunches are provided so guests can explore the park during the day. The breakfast buffet includes toast, eggs, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, ham, cheese, jam, honey, juice, coffee and tea. Picnics feature assorted sandwiches, fruit, cookies, and juices. Dinners vary depending on seasonal availability, but generally include an appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert. On occasion, we’ll hold traditional Patagonian asados (barbeques) for all guests and staff. We’re happy to accommodate special eating concerns if you let us know ahead of time.
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    As an eco-lodge, the facility minimizes its impact with energy-efficient construction and design, locally quarried stone, recycled wood, and solar panels. We grow many of our own vegetables in greenhouses located just behind the Lodge. All of our meat is grassfed and raised locally.
                                                   <br></br>
                                                    Conservacion Patagonica operates The Lodge at Valle Chacabuco as part of its effort to create the future Patagonia National Park. Conservation Patagonica, the non-profit organisation set up by Kris and Doug Tompkins, already controls around 200,000 acres of grassland and forest in the Chacabuco Valley, where the lodge is situated. This acreage abuts two existing reserves, Jeinimeni and Tamango, and the plan is to join them to the Tompkins' land, creating a park of 650,000 acres, about one and a half times the size of Torres del Paine National Park, the best-known and most visited park in Patagonia. The acclaimed eco-lodge is the only fixed accommodation within the existing acreage (though numerous campgrounds are available). 


                                                   Dates of availability: October 15th through April 15th.

                                                    <p>This trip is far from a "packaged tour." Think of it more as a "floating backcountry lodge" in the midst of one of the world's great arctic wildernesses that will allow you to truly grasp the sense of place that the remote Hornstrandir conveys. Even though we may not be far from “home,“ this is still true exploration and the final itinerary will only be decided upon when we leave Ísafjörður harbour. Below is the most likely itinerary, but we will take into account weather and snow-conditions and always look for the best possible option. <br/><br/>
                                                        <strong>Day 1</strong><br>
                                                    Departure from Ísafjörður will take place at 19:00, with 2-4 hours of sailing to Hesteyri in the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve. We will relax at anchor and maybe do some exploration on the Zodiac and take a look at the old whaling station that once was the driving force in this now abandoned settlement. Since it will still bright in the evening during the latter part of the season, for later trips we will have an option to do a short ski run.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 2</strong><br>
                                                    We'll begin the day with a safety briefing that will include avalanche search techniques and an explanation of what to do in case of an emergency. We will then ski from Hesteyrarfjörður to Veiðileysufjörður ('fjord with no fish'!). The climb up Hesteyrarfjörður is very easy and the ski slopes on the other side offers many possibilities. We may end the day by skiing the steepest slope of the trip, 45°-50° in steepness (of course this is optional—you can head down to the yacht if you prefer!). Dinner will be at anchor in Veiðileysufjörður.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 3</strong><br>
                                                    We will ski to Lónafjörður (lagoon fjord). We begin the day by climbing up to one of the cols to take a look at the bays on the north side. We then ski down to the first valley in Lónafjörður and climb at least two more mountains before meeting Aurora again in the evening.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 4</strong><br>
                                                    Here, we normally spend an extra day at the beautiful Rangali anchorage. Here are endless opportunities for skiing. From steep couloirs to rolling hills. One route will take us to the Snókur Mountain with a good view of the coastal mountains on the east side of Hornstrandir. Often there is an opportunity to pick mussels for après ski!</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 5</strong><br>
                                                    Today we skin up from the Sópandi inlet and over to Hrafnfjörður (Raven Fjord). The mountain cirque at the head of the fjord is very beautiful and the anchorage is a perfect spot to spend the night.</br></br>
                                                    <strong>Day 6</strong><br>
                                                    We will have a morning ski session before sailing back to Ísafjörður, with arrival around 16:00 in the afternoon. You can catch the last flight from Ísafjörður that night, though we suggest staying at least one night in Ísafjörður to relax and get to know this old and beautiful town.</p>

                                                    Although I ski on a daily basis, I've never been guided. The thought of an adamant guide choosing objectives and approaches, insisting on breaking trail, and mandating the location of every kick turn terrifies me. A guide telling you how fast you can't ski and constantly mentioning their breadth of experience and avalanche this and that isn't what I was looking for when I signed on for a trip with Borea. Instead, I wanted real skiers to show me the terrain available in their back yard. I wanted them to be Icelandic, to speak English, to understand what I wanted to ski, and to create a package perfect for what our group of skiers sought. I found my desires, and avoided my hesitancies, in Borea. Understanding the skill level and wishes of our group would not be an easy undertaking for a service who is used to spoon-feeding clients. I'm not sure if this is what Aurora is used to, but our requests surely did not seem to present an issue. And this includes some strange dietary requests, along with first descent requests. The pre-trip communication was adequate without being overwhelming, the logistics were handled but malleable, and the objectives were open for discussion. And while this isn't what every group will need, and surely not the only type of service that Aurora offers, it's what we wanted. Never having been guided before, I wasn't even fully clear on what I wanted. I was familiar with my fears and hesitation in hiring a guide, but unfamiliar with what the experience would actually be like. After a few days in far-fetched Icelandic fjords, I learn that guides aren't necessarily the outdoor version of "desk jockeys" that wear pins with all sorts of acronyms on them. Instead, they're friends. I will absolutely return to Aurora next time I'm in Iceland. And I'm coming back to Iceland next year because Aurora is here.</br></br>

                                                    We came as a group of professional skiers from the USA to have a unique ski experience in Iceland. From day 1 the Aurora team impressed us with their organization, communication and professionalism. We were so delighted when we met the crew in isafjordur to learn that equal to their professionalism is their friendly and relaxed nature. Over the next five days we had an incredible adventure transported by van, speedboat, sailboat, dingy and ski touring. We made first descents, saw beautiful sights, wildlife and captured the whole experience with the in house photographer, hauker. The team was on point as ski guides, cooks, organizers, story tellers and eventually dear friends. Whatever your desires are for your Iceland vacation, I have no doubt Borea Adventure will take immaculate care of you.<br></br>

                                                    I went on a weeklong ski tour with Borea adventures in Hornstrandir in May 2012 with a group of friends. Siggi (the captain and chef or Aurora) and Örvar (ski guide) led us through unforgettable week of skiing, sailing, eating and having fun in an environment that simply cannot be matched. Different fjord each day with excellent ski slopes that runs down to the ocean. Excellent food on board. I highly recommend this tour.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>WEATHER</strong><br>Iceland is a land of very mixed weather. As they say, if you don´t like the weather, wait for ten minutes! Usually the spring brings higher pressure and settled weather, but be prepared for everything from dead calm and sunny days to blowing blizzards.

                                                    From the domestic airport in Reykjavík, there are 2-3 daily 40-minute flights to Ísafjörður. You can take the Fly-Bus (www.flybus.is ) between the airports and, depending on flight arrivals and departures, it may be possible to continue onwards to Ísafjörður the same day. Browse Air Iceland (www.airiceland.is ) for schedules and special offers.You can also rent a car and drive to Ísafjörður. The drive is 450 km (on paved roads in its entirety),  and normally takes approximately six hours.<br><br/>
                                                    <strong>Please arrive in Ísafjörður ahead of our planned sailing time of 19.00 (7pm) to meet the crew, stow your gear aboard our yacht and pick up any last minute supplies.</strong> Arrival transfers are included from Ísafjörður Airport to the harbour. Let us know in advance your arrival time in Ísafjörður so we can arrange to pick you up. We strongly recommend spending a few extra days visiting the West Fjords near Ísafjörður as well as other parts of Iceland. We are happy to help you plan your trip in more detail.<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>FINISHING POINT</strong><br>Aurora will return to Ísafjörður Harbour on the trip's final day. Transfer to Ísafjörður airport is included if leaving the same day. A cheap Fly-Bus (www.flybus.is ) is available for those staying extra days in the area.<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL</strong><br>
                                                    We believe strongly in low impact -or rather 'positive impact' tourism. Broadly speaking, this means that we try to minimise the negative aspects of tourism on the local cultures and environments that we visit and highlight the positive aspects. The beauty of this trip is that we use nature's renewable energy to power the majority of our needs.<br></br> 


                                                    <strong>HEALTH AND PHYSICAL PREPARATION</strong><br>All travellers need to be in good physical health in order to participate fully in the group travel experience. If, in the opinion of our group leader, any traveller is unable to complete the itinerary without undue risk to themselves and/or the rest of the group, Aurora-Arktika reserves the right to exclude them from all or part of a trip without refund. We therefore ask that you read the itinerary in these trip notes thoroughly and then realistically self-assess your physical ability to complete the trip as described. Please consult with your doctor if you have any doubts.<br></br>
                                                    While no specific physical preparation is required for this voyage, to get the most out of the land and sea activities, a better than average fitness level is recommended. We recommend that you undertake regular aerobic exercise in the weeks before you travel, particularly if you are not in the habit of regular exercise. And of course the best way to get into shape for skiing...is skiing!<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>YOUR FELLOW TRAVELLERS</strong><br>
                                                    As you travel in a group trip you will be exposed to both the pleasures and as well as the frustrations of travelling in a group. Your fellow travellers will probably come from all corners of the world and are likely to cover a range of age groups. We ask that you be understanding of the various needs and preferences of your group—patience with your fellow travellers is sometimes required for the benefit of everyone's travel experience. Remember that you have certain responsibilities to the group. We have found time and time again that the very best trips we operate are those where the dynamics within the group work well—this only takes a little effort on your part. Please note that due to privacy reasons we are unable to provide you with contact details and any personal information about your fellow travellers booked on your trip, prior to departure, unless they choose to share such info.<br><br/>

                                                    <strong>FOOD</strong><br>
                                                    We take great pride in the food we serve on board Aurora and use local produce and ingredients as much as we can. Arctic char, cod, lamb and berries and rhubarb pies for desserts are common. We can cater for vegetarians and guests with dietary restrictions. Please let us know in advance. It´s a good idea to take some of your own dietary substitutes if you have a specialist diet.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>VISAS</strong><br>
                                                    No visa is required for trips to Iceland of up to 3 months for most nationalities. Please check with your consulate in advance of your proposed travel date.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>ACCOMMODATION AND TRANSFER</strong><br>
                                                    Aurora-Arktika can help with arranging accommodation in Reykjavík, please enquire. For accommodation in Ísafjörður, we recommend Gamla Guesthouse (www.gistihus.is) in the centre of town. Good atmosphere in an old refurbished house. Please mention that you´re coming on a trip with us in order to receive a 15% discount.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>COMMUNICATION</strong><br>
                                                    There is good mobile phone coverage and internet service in Ísafjörður. Mobile coverage is not good where we travel, though most days there is reception on the mountain tops! On board, Aurora will have a satellite phone that can be used for urgent calls or emails.<br></br> 

                                                    <strong>SEA-SICKNESS</strong><br>
                                                    We only sail short distances during this trip, and sea sickness has not proven to be problematic. Still, it´s a good idea to bring medication if you know you are prone to seasickness or you think it will be helpful.<br></br>

                                                    <strong>BOOKING CONDITIONS AND INSURANCES</strong><br>
                                                    The Aurora-Arktika´s trips/voyages are of an adventurous nature given the relatively remote places throughout Iceland, Greenland and beyond that we travel. Aurora-Arktika makes its best effort to stick to the planned itinerary, but participants should appreciate and acknowledge that the trip/voyage requires considerable flexibility. Further, given the unpredictability of travel in such locations, the captain or Aurora-Arktika cannot be held responsible for incidents, accidents or physical injuries.The company and captain of the vessel reserve the right to adjust the itinerary without notice for reasons beyond their control, such as weather, ice-conditions or other unpredictable or unforeseeable circumstances. Upon departure, the captain will have the final say on all decisions affecting safety, etc., and this must be accepted by all participants. <br></br>

                                                    Sailing and other outdoor activities in the trips can be dangerous and require an average level of fitness and good health. It is the responsibility of all participants to ensure that they obtain proper and detailed medical advice. In case of a medical problem arising during the voyage, either on-board or onshore, which results in medical expenses—including but not limited to costs for evacuation with use of aircraft or boat and repatriation—the responsibility for payment of these costs belongs solely to the respective participant. We require that the participants ensure that such eventualities are covered by travel insurance. If for any reason an incident is not covered by travel insurance, the responsibility still remains with the participant. Be aware that a normal travel policy may not cover you for some geographical areas that we travel and there may be exclusions for what they describe as "hazardous sports," which may include sailing, climbing, skiing and diving (especially in remote areas). Before arrival, participants must provide the name, address and telephone numbers for emergency contacts who can be reached should it prove necessary.<br></br>

                                                    Any personal belongings taken on-board the yacht by participants are taken entirely at the participants risk.  As such, Aurora-Arktika shall not be liable for any loss or damage occurring to them.<br></br>


                                                    <strong>ISSUES ON YOUR TRIP</strong><br>
                                                    While we always endeavour to provide the best possible holiday experience, due to the nature of travel and the areas we visit sometimes things can and do go wrong. Should any issue occur while you are on your trip it is imperative that you discuss this with your group leader or the captain straight away so that they can do their best to rectify the problem and mitigate any potential negative impacts during the rest of your trip.<br></br>
